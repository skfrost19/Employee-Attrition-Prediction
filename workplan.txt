====  Data Transformation ====
transform the data as follows:
-convert categorical data to numerical data
-handle missing values
-standardize the data
-upsample the data


==== Model Trainer ====
- apply random forest classifier
- save the model as `model.pkl` in a folder called `models` in root directory 

==== Pipeline ====
- create a pipeline to load the model and predict the target value

====  General ====

-delete useless columns: 'BusinessTravel', 'Department','Gender', 'JobRole', 'MaritalStatus', 'OverTime','EducationField'
-handle imbalanced data
-plot a graph for attrition target value (yes and no)

-apply random forest classifier
-apply logistic regression
-apply svm classifier
-apply all the above with cross validation

-take test size as 0.2 and random state as 123

-compare the results of the three models
-choose the best model
-apply grid search to improve the model
