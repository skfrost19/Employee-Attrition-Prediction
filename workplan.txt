====  Data Transformation ====
transform the data as follows:
-convert categorical data to numerical data
-standardize the data
-upsample the data


==== Model Trainer ====
- apply random forest classifier
- save the model as `model.pkl` in a folder called `models` in root directory


==== Encoders ====
- save the encoders {label_encoder, standard scalar}.


==== Pipeline ====
- create a pipeline to load the model and predict the target value


===== Predict =====
- create a function to predict the target value
- the function should take a dictionary as input and return the prediction


====  General ====

-delete useless columns: [
                    "HourlyRate",
                    "PercentSalaryHike",
                    "MonthlyRate",
                    "PerformanceRating",
                    "EducationField",
                    "EmployeeNumber",
                    "Over18",
                    "StandardHours",
                    "Education",
                    "Gender",
                ]
-handle imbalanced data
-plot a graph for attrition target value (yes and no)

-apply random forest classifier
-apply logistic regression
-apply svm classifier
-apply all the above with cross validation

-take test size as 0.2 and random state as 123

-compare the results of the three models
-choose the best model

===== Future Work =====

-apply grid search to improve the model
